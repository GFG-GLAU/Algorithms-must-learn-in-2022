Gnome Sort also called Stupid sort is based on the concept of a Garden Gnome sorting his flower pots.
A garden gnome sorts the flower pots by the following method-  



He looks at the flower pot next to him and the previous one; if they are in the right order
he steps one pot forward, otherwise he swaps them and steps one pot backwards.
If there is no previous pot (he is at the starting of the pot line), he steps forwards; 
if there is no pot next to him (he is at the end of the pot line), he is done.


Algorithm Steps:

If you are at the start of the array then go to the right element (from arr[0] to arr[1]).
If the current array element is larger or equal to the previous array element then go one step right
 if (arr[i] >= arr[i-1])
 i++;

If the current array element is smaller than the previous array element then swap these two elements and go one step backwards
 if (arr[i] < arr[i-1])
{
swap(arr[i], arr[i-1]);
 i–;
} 

Repeat steps 2) and 3) till ‘i’ reaches the end of the array (i.e- ‘n-1’)
If the end of the array is reached then stop and the array is sorted.

//code

import java.util.Arrays;
public class GFG {
    static void gnomeSort(int arr[], int n)
    {
        int index = 0;
  
        while (index < n) {
            if (index == 0)
                index++;
            if (arr[index] >= arr[index - 1])
                index++;
            else {
                int temp = 0;
                temp = arr[index];
                arr[index] = arr[index - 1];
                arr[index - 1] = temp;
                index--;
            }
        }
        return;
    }
  
    // Driver program to test above functions.
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        int arr[] = { 34, 2, 10, -9 };
  
        gnomeSort(arr, arr.length);
  
        System.out.print("Sorted sequence after applying Gnome sort: ");
        System.out.println(Arrays.toString(arr));
    }
}
Output
Sorted sequence after Gnome sort: -9 2 10 34

Time complexity of this approach is o(n^2)
